// Call Constructor in main process to create the needed MiniSearch instances for
// all searchable items (projects, notes, etc. all need their own instance

// Once they're created, will need to go to the database, fetch all the items, and add them to the correct miniSearch index

// The constructor will also hold the logic for what we want to search by
